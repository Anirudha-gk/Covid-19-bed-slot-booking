A COVID-19 bed slot booking system is an essential digital tool designed to streamline the process of allocating hospital beds to patients infected with the virus. This system enables healthcare facilities to efficiently manage and track bed availability, ensuring that patients receive timely care. By allowing patients or their caregivers to book slots online, the system reduces the administrative burden on hospital staff and minimizes waiting times. It also helps in maintaining accurate records of bed occupancy and patient status, facilitating better resource allocation and ensuring that critical care is available when needed. Such a system is crucial in managing the high demand for hospital beds during pandemic surges, ultimately contributing to more effective and organized healthcare delivery.
